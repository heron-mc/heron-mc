Changes to dateslider.js and TimeSliderPanel.js
===============================================

First integration in Heron
--------------------------

Implementation of TimeSliderPanel as User Extension (ux) in Heron.

    
New example:

    timeslider
    

Set the right order of loading libraries/frameworks in (index.)html to minimize interference between frameworks:

    Start with:
        prototype.js
        scriptaculous.js
        ext-prototype-adapter.js
    Proceed with:
        ext-base.js
        ext-all.js

    Other libraries like Openlayers and GeoExt, stylesheets

    This component:
        date-en-US.js
        dateslider.js
        TimeSliderPanel.js

    End with configuration files:
        DefaultOptionsNL.js
        Config.js

        
Performed upgrades:

    scriptaculous.js 1.8.0 -> 1.9.0 (only dragdrop, effects, scriptatculous, prototype)
    prototype.js 1.6.0 -> 1.7.1 (included in scriptaculous)
    

override-openlayers.js

    Added time parameter for WMS as this is not yet available in OpenLayers 2.12
    

Made following parameters configurable through Config.js (see TimeSliderPanel.js for API):

    layerNames
    timelineStartYear
    timelineEndYear
    timelineCenterDate
    timelineDayWidth
    timelineZoom
    filterTitle
    filterStartDate
    filterEndDate  


Fixes in dataslider.js:

    Moving timeline background changed from hardcoded "width (600)" to "$('slider-container').getWidth()"
    Sliding to the left (outside of the visible part of the timeline) now also results in moving the timeline background.
    Incorrect display of shiftpanel / left-right handles fixed by adding "change" listener


Changes in TimeSliderPanel.js:

    Added API descriptions and defaults for configurable parameters
    Changes in code to replace hard coded values with paramaters
    Changes to configure one or more layers to be effected by time filter
    Removed dead code
    Explicit declaration of variables
    Let initial filter have effect on time on effected layers (TODO)
    
    
Heron naming and coding convention:

    xtype: 'hr_timesliderpanel'
    id: 'hr-timesliderpanel'
    Heron.widgets.TimeSliderPanel
    indentation
    brackets
