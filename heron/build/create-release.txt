Just van den Broecke - created 20 june 2011

Steps to create release:

- copy Roadmap in Wiki https://github.com/heron-mc/heron-mc/wiki/Roadmap to CHANGES.md

- change release number in several files:
    docsrc/_theme/default/layout.html
    docsrc/conf.py
    docsrc/downloads.rst
    heron/build/Makefile
    heron/lib/App.js

- be sure to check-in everything

Build

Req: need Python 2.7 env, e.g. pyenv activate heron-2.7
With following pip packages, with specific versions!

* jstools==0.2.2 (low version!)
* jinja2==2.7.2

See requirements.txt for complete list of Python deps.

- in /heron/build run "make zip"

- sync the libraries and release heron-xyz.zip to lib.heron-mc.org: "make sync-rel-prod"

- create branch/tag/release on GitHub https://github.com/heron-mc/heron-mc/releases

- run ./update-website.sh

This whole procedure needs to be simplified, but normally this
should not take more than 10 minutes.
