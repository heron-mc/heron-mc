<h2>About this Example</h2>
<hr>
<p>Demontrates interactive styling for Vector Layers from any data source: local Vector files like GPX,
    WFS Layers, Uploaded data and per-feature Styling in a Drawing (Redlining) Layer</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Open the Vector Style Dialog on any visible layer in Active Themes Panel by using the right-mouse button on Layer
    entry (context menu).
    Activate WFS layers (may need to zoom in) and try styling them as thematic map. For example
    the WFS Layer "BAG Panden" (Buildings) contains polygons+attributes for all buildings in The Netherlands.
    Each building has a "bouwjaar" attribute, indicating its year of build. By adding rules (via Duplicate) and
    Conditions with different colors, one can visualize the built-up of a city center through the ages.
</p>
<p>
    The Drawing Layer allows styling features even individually:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>changing the style will be the new style for newly drawn features</li>
    <li>by selecting features (using Select tool) one can restyle one or more features</li>
</ol>

<h3>Widgets</h3>
<p>GXP VectorStyleDialog, GXP extension by Heron developers on GXP</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
    Vector Styling makes use of both GXP Styling widgets, originally for WMS-SLD editing and
    OpenLayers Styling classes. Styling is (now) always local, i.e. Styles cannot be saved/loaded, though that may be
    a nice add-on, e.g. as SLDs...

</p>
<p>
    We are working with GXP-folks to see if Vector Styling can be ported back into the GXP master branch.
