The OpenLayers Editor (OLE) is a set of OpenLayers widgets developed by GeOps http://www.geops.de.

The source repository is on GitHub https://github.com/geops/ole.
The original set of widgets has been extended (Upload/Download/Text Labels and some more) for use in Heron,
but possibly in any OpenLayers app.
These extensions are maintained in GitHub as well:
https://github.com/justb4/ole as a fork of the GeOps master branch.
At the moment (14.mrt.2013) this fork is awaiting inclusion into the master branch.

The directory 'client' below contains only the OLE client library.
It is synchronized via svn:externals from https://github.com/justb4/ole/trunk/client.
The SVN link is: https://github.com/justb4/ole/trunk/client
(GitHub support SVN access)

The command used to set the svn:externals is (onder ole dir):

svn propset svn:externals . -F svn-ext-val.txt

If you checkout Heron via SVN the OLEditor client will automatically be included.

Use the minimized ole/ole.min.js version in your production app.

See also the Heron example "editorbasics" how to use. Only CSS and minifed JS needs to be included:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../ux/oleditor/ole/client/theme/geosilk/geosilk.css" type="text/css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="../../ux/oleditor/ole/ole.min.js"></script>
