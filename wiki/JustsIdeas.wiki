#summary Just's ideas on new features and things to do in general

Author: [http://www.justobjects.nl Just van den Broecke]

Below are some of my ideas as input for our meeting at Geodan on June 22, 2010. 

= General =

In general my aim is to provide a highly configurable and extensible geo-webclient that can be used in a variety of projects. In particular there is interest within the Dutch Kadaster for web-based applications and for INSPIRE (e.g. ExM visualisation within ESDIN). My personal interest is to use this as a basis within specific tracking &amp; tracing clients such as [http://geoskating.com].

= New Features =

  # support WFS Vector layers 
  # support for themes via multiple levels in Layerbrowser tree hierarchy
  # user-interaction and visualisation for making a layer active
  # zoom to layer extent
  # active layer query interaction (GetFeatureInfo or WFS Query)
  # WFS styling (with SLD within OpenLayers?)
  # Info panel: get info on theme
  # variable Layer transparency e.g. with slider
  # printing (via MapFish PDF)
  # configurable toolbar
  # FeatureInfoPanel should support complex features (e.g. INSPIRE features)
  # the "site" example should really become a new feature

= Examples =
  
  # provide example with embedding in page

= Tasks =
   
  # review overall architecture
  # adding features to issue list
  # release policy (release milestones with attached features)
  # SVN branching/tagging policy
  # documentation
  # providing downloadable versions
  # dealing with external libs (ExtJS, OpenLayers, GeoExt)
  # dealing with hosting versions
 
= Various =

  # update/test to/with latest GeoExt version
