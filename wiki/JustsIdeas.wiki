#summary Just's ideas on new features and things to do in general

*THIS IS OLD STUFF NOW - NEEDS TO REVISED OR REMOVED*

(and most of this has been realized)


Author: [http://www.justobjects.nl Just van den Broecke]

Below are some of my ideas as input for our meeting at Geodan on June 22, 2010. 
Results from that meeting are in _italic font_.

= General =

In general my aim is to provide a highly configurable and extensible geo-webclient that can be used in a variety of projects. In particular there is interest within the Dutch Kadaster for web-based applications and for INSPIRE (e.g. ExM visualisation within ESDIN). My personal interest is to use this as a basis within specific tracking & tracing clients such as [http://geoskating.com].

_In general we will aim first to provide features to support the ESDIN demo client since both Kadaster and Geodan participate in ESDIN. In the longer term we aim for a reusable web client for projects/NMCA's like/within INSPIRE, in general a client is able to deal with ISO Application Schemas. "

= New Features =

  # support WFS Vector layers
    _already works: seethe esdin example (need proxy)_
  # support for themes via multiple levels in Layerbrowser tree hierarchy 
    _see issue 12 _
  # user-interaction and visualisation for making a layer active
     _see issue 6 _
  # zoom to layer extent
     _see issue 9 _
  # active layer query interaction (GetFeatureInfo or WFS Query)
     _see issue 5 _
  # WFS styling (with SLD within OpenLayers?
     _OpenLayers has styling for vector layers (see esdin example)_
  # Info panel: get info on theme
     _see issue 10 (tooltip with layerinfo)_
  # variable Layer transparency e.g. with slider
     _will be part of issue 12_
  # printing (via MapFish PDF)
     _see issue 15 _
  # configurable toolbar
     _see issue 13 _
  # FeatureInfoPanel should support complex features (e.g. INSPIRE features)
  # the "site" example should really become a new feature

= Examples =
  
  # provide example with embedding in page

= Tasks =
   
  # review overall architecture
  # adding features to issue list
  # release policy (release milestones with attached features)
  # SVN branching/tagging policy
   _we will start with version 0.1 working towards 1.0.0_
  # documentation
  # providing downloadable versions
  # dealing with external libs (ExtJS, OpenLayers, GeoExt)
   _these will for now be hosted on http://kademo.nl/lib _
  # providing hosted versions (including external libs/resources)
   _these will for now be hosted on http://kademo.nl/lib _
  # hosting the examples
   _these will for now be hosted on http://kademo.nl/lib/geoext-viewer/heron/examples _
  # make others aware (e.g. Bart and GeoExt folks) of this project
   _ ok _
  # investigate how to relate/contribute this to GeoExt project
   _ok when we have useful components_
  # invite others for this project ?
 
= Various =

  # update/test to/with latest GeoExt version
   _ done, now at 0.7 hosted from http://kademo.nl/lib/geoext/0.7 _
  # is OpenLayers ready for GML 3.2.1 ? What is the issue ? Something we can do ?
   _for now we will support GML 3.1.1_
