This is the Roadmap including all history. 
The file [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/heron-mc/heron-mc/blob/master/CHANGES.md) is a copy of the [roadmap in the Wiki](https://github.com/heron-mc/heron-mc/wiki/Roadmap).

In each Heron MC release a set of issues (bugs/features) implemented for that release is included. 
In GitHub a release is associated with a Milestone. A Milestone is a set of issues implemented/resolved and PRs for that Milestone.

# Unplanned Issues #
"Unplanned" means these issues have been identified and recognized but not yet assigned to a Milestone/release.

Basically this is the full feature list at
