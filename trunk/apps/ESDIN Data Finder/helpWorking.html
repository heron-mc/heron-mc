<p>The purpose of this web application is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To view available data on the map. This is dependent on the avialabilty of View Services.</li>
  <li>To select a subset of data to download to the local computer. This is dependent on the avialabilty of Download Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no perfect match between available View Services and Download Services. Presently, there are much more Download Services than View Services. So if a feature type is not visible on the map it could still be possible to download features in that area.</p>
<p>Data to be downloaded can be selected by two criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spatial extent (define an area of interest by drawing a rectangle while pressing the 'Alt' button).</li>
  <li>Feature types within themes (select one or more feature types in the <em>Map layers</em> panel).</li>
</ul>
