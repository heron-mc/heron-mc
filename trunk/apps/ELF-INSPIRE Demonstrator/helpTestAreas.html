<body>
<p>
Test Areas are areas that have been identified as being exceptionally interesting. A Test Area
can be interesting for several reasons. It could have a good data coverage, it could
show border crossing features or it could contain high quality data. The reason for the existence 
of any test area should be apparant in its description.</p>

<p>
Test Areas are available as a map layer. To see all Test Areas in the map, check the box before "Test Areas"
 in the "Map layers" on the left. Clicking in a Test Area on the map will display its description.
</p>
 
<p>
The Test Areas menu lists all Test Area names and can be used to zoom in on one Test Area.
