<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The ESDIN client is a Javascript web client. Its purpose is to provide
interaction with ESDIN services (View Services and Download Services).</p>

<p></p>

<h1>Design guidelines</h1>

<p>We have tried to follow the following guidlines:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It should be easy to add or change WMSs or WFSs for non-developers</li>
  <li>It should be easy to edit the help files</li>
</ol>

<h1>Prerequisitites </h1>

<p>The following libraries are used. They are all referenced in
<em>index.html</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>OpenLayers (download: <a
    href="http://trac.osgeo.org/openlayers/wiki/HowToDownload">http://trac.osgeo.org/openlayers/wiki/HowToDownload</a>)</li>
  <li>GeoExt (download: <a
    href="http://www.geoext.org/downloads.html">http://www.geoext.org/downloads.html</a>)</li>
  <li>ExtJS (download: <a
    href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/download/">http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/download/</a>
    or<a
    href="http://www.sencha.com/learn/Ext_Version_Archives">http://www.sencha.com/learn/Ext_Version_Archives</a>)</li>
  <li>Proj4Js (download: <a
    href="http://trac.osgeo.org/proj4js/wiki/Download">http://trac.osgeo.org/proj4js/wiki/Download</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Search by name</h2>

<p>The 'search for a geographical name' functionality depends on a database
with names data. See <em>data_preperation.sql</em> for the process of preparing
the database, using PostgreSQL and PostGIS. The file <em>complete.php</em>
should be runnable on the local web server. </p>

<h2>Downloading GML from WFSs</h2>

<p>This depends on an adaptation of the web server that hosst the client. See
httpd.conf.fragment for the extra configuration needed for the Apache HTTP
server.</p>

<p></p>

<h1>To Do</h1>

<p>This is a list of things that still need to be done or looked in to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Axis orientation of epsg:3034: We learned to late that epsg:3034 uses an
    axis order of northing,easting. The coordinates displayed below the map are
    okay, but other coordinate processing might be confused.</li>
  <li>Allowing the mapping of one feature type in the tree view (EC_Themes) to
    multiple WFS feature types was a recent addition. For example, this allows
    both <em>xlau:AdministrativeUnit</em> and <em>au:AdministrativeUnit</em> to
    map to the Administrative Units feature type in the tree. This means that
    is possible now to add ExM Download Services that could not be added
    before. However, these extra Download Services have not been add to
    <em>downloadServices.js</em> yet.</li>
</ol>
