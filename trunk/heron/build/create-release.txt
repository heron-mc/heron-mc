Steps to create release:

- change release number in several files under /docsrc:
    conf.py
    downloads.rst
    _theme/default/layout.html

- change release number in /heron/build/Makefile

- be sure to check-in everything

- in /heron/build run "make zip"

- sync the libraries to lib.heron-mc.org: "make sync-rel-prod"

- create download on project site

- tag release : in /tools/build run "./tag-release.sh release-<nr>" e.g.
./tag-release.sh release-0.61

- upload website : in /tools/build run ./update-website.sh

This whole procedure needs to be simplified, but normally this
should not take more than 10 minutes.
