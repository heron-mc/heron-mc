This is a clone of the GXP project maintained by OpenGeo (gxp.opengeo.org).

The files are not maintained here but included as a submodule from an external repo.

This is effected as follows:

1. via SVN externals property the repo: https://github.com/justb4/gxp (master) is included automatically
2. https://github.com/justb4/gxp/ is a clone of https://github.com/opengeo/gxp (master)
3. in https://github.com/justb4/gxp small fixes are made for Heron compat
4. any structural changes will be offered to the GXP project via GitHub "pull"
5. the file gxp.js is a minified build of https://github.com/justb4/gxp, checked in only on changes
and using the original GXP build tools (Buildkit, Ringo via "ant buildjs" command).

To include GXP see example "querybuilder":

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../../ux/gxp/git/src/theme/all.css"/>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="../../ux/gxp/gxp.js"></script>
