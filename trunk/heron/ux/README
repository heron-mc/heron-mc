This directory contains User Extensions (ux).

In general these are third-party components
that extend the ExtJS, GeoExt and OpenLayers frameworks.
Most are maintained externally in their own project repository.

One of the goals of Heron is to incorporate GeoExt and OpenLayers components,
mainly adding/extending these for configurability and Heron compatibility.
For more structural changes we work as much as possible with the master project.

Most extensions are prebuilt, so only the minified JS and some CSS needs to
be included in your HTML file.

The following extensions are available.

gxp: OpenGeo GXP is a powerful framework by itself based on GeoExt

oleditor: OpenLayers Editor by GeOps. Additions developed by Heron integrated in official master.

printpreview: a copy of the official version, currently many Heron-specific changes, maintained here

timeslider: Dateslider based on Scriptaculous/Prototype integrated in Heron
