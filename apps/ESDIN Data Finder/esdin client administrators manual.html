<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The ESDIN client is a Javascript web client. Its purpose is to provide
interaction with ESDIN services (View Services and Download Services).</p>

<p>This manual provides instructions for those in charge of maintenance of the
client. Changing client settings is done by making changes in one of the
configuration files. These are the configuration files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>layers.js</li>
  <li>downloadServices.js</li>
  <li>testAreas.js</li>
  <li>configuration.js</li>
</ul>

<p>All these files are javascript files. However, no knowledge of the
javascript language is needed. The javascript syntax rules need to be obeyed,
but it should be possible to change settings by copy/paste/cut operations,
optionally followed by changing text strings (enclosed in double quotes
(")).</p>

<h1>Managing basic settings</h1>

<p>Basic settings are found in the file <em>configuration.js</em>. Among other
things, the following settings are made here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The name of the client</li>
  <li>Often used URLs</li>
  <li>Definition of Service Providers</li>
  <li>Definition of themes and feature types</li>
</ul>

<p>Each setting is headed by a comment explaining what the setting does. </p>

<h1>Managing View Services</h1>

<p>View Services are configured in <em>layers.js</em>. Each View Service shoudl
be configured as an OpenLayers WMS layer. Existing layer definitions can be
used as templates for new layers. Values that have been set in
<em>configuration.js</em> may be used here, but that is not necessary.</p>

<h1>Managing Download Services</h1>

<p>Download Services are configure in <em>downloadServices.js</em>. </p>

<h1>Managing test areas</h1>

<p>Download Services are configure in <em>testAreas.js</em>. </p>

<h1>Managing help pages</h1>

<p>Help pages are avialable to the user through the help menu. The names of the
help files correspond with the menu items. Help files are plain HTML files,
they can be edited with any HTML editor.</p>
